In every child's life there is one teacher whose advice, wisdom and teachings remain engraved in the mind for a lifetime. For me, it's you. A great teacher does not crack down rebellion in a student, but channels it in the right way. And you did just that. I take pride in having learnt from a teacher like you. happy birthday, Kothiyal Sir.
